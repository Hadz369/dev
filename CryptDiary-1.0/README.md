# CryptDiary
encrypted Diary

Years ago I was looking for a diary which was a) open source and b) stores its content encrypted. Found nothing... So, finally I decided to write it on my own.

So this diary has a user interface similar to RedNotebook, but saves every diary entry 256 bit AES encrypted.

It's my first C# project, so feel free to show me flaws and make things better than I did.
